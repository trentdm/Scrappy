Scrappy
=======

A node.js app that facilitates scraping web pages for updates and tweeting their content.

Get started
=======
The project is dependent on a config file containing your twitter handle and its application's requisite
 authentication information. See https://apps.twitter.com/app/new for setting up a twitter app.

You will also want to modify the intended target urls for scraping, as well as the scraping method. See
https://www.npmjs.org/package/cheerio for help in parsing your pages.

ToDo
======
Move parsing into its own module.
